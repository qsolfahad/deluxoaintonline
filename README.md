### `/archive`

- **wordpress-core/**: Original WordPress installation files (wp-admin, wp-content, wp-includes)
- **duplicates/**: Duplicate index files and other unused files

## 🔍 File Naming Conventions

- Main pages use `index.html` in their respective directories
- Product pages are in `/product/[product-slug]/index.html`
- Duplicate files (index0813.html, etc.) have been moved to `/archive/duplicates/`

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Homepage**: Access `index.html` at the root
2. **Pages**: Navigate to `/pages/[page-name]/index.html`
3. **Products**: Access products at `/product/[product-slug]/index.html`
4. **Assets**: Reference assets using paths like `/assets/css/style.css`

## 📝 Notes

- This is a static HTML version of a WordPress/WooCommerce site
- All WordPress core files have been moved to `/archive/wordpress-core/`
- Duplicate and unused files are in `/archive/duplicates/`
- The structure is optimized for easy navigation and maintenance

## 🔧 Maintenance

When adding new:
- **CSS files**: Place in `/assets/css/`
- **JavaScript files**: Place in `/assets/js/`
- **Images**: Place in `/assets/images/`
- **Fonts**: Place in `/assets/fonts/`
- **Pages**: Create new directory in `/pages/` with `index.html`
